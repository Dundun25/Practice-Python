#This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.

#Take two lists, say for example these two:
    #a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	#b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
#and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
#Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of Python using at least one list comprehension. (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

#The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one line of Python, 
#but a few readers pointed out that this was impossible to do without using sets that I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can either choose to use the original directive and read about the set command in Python 3.3,
#or try to implement this on your own and use at least one list comprehension in the solution.

#Extra:

#Randomly generate two lists to test this

from random import randint

#generating random list
a = [randint(1,100) for x in range(12)]
b = [randint(1,100) for x in range(20)]
#mixing the list
c = a+b
#create holder variable for the unique number
unique = []
#looping using list comprehensions
d = [unique.append(x) for x in c if x not in unique] 
#output
print(f'a({len(a)})\t\t: {a} \nb({len(b)})\t\t: {b}\nunique({len(unique)})\t: {unique}')
#if you want to use "set" method : unique = [set(a+b)]
#but "set" method will affect your number order
